notes and exercises from the statistical simulation in python course of
datacamp: 

https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/statistical-simulation-in-python/

this is just for personal use, so don't expect everything to be super
documented. Also if you want this info but better presented and useful got
take the course.

quick tip: you can try datacamp for 3 months for free if you have a 
github student account. So go ahead and try it.
